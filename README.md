# Bookings-Incremental-Data-Processing-with-SCD2-Merge-Project
The Bookings Incremental Data Processing with SCD2 Merge project efficiently tracks historical changes in booking data using the SCD2 method. It processes only new or updated records, preserves old data with "end dates," and stores it in Delta Lake for scalable, consistent data management and reporting.
